# Physiological based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation for the distribution of tranexamic acid in human

## Goal

The goal of this Physiological based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation exercise is to understand the factor that impact tranexamic acid (TXA) distribution in human. In particular, the distribution of TXA distribuition in skin after oral intake of the drug. I would like to know more under the dosing regimen of Transino II (by Daiichi Sankyo Healthcare, which aims to treat melasma), how TXA would distribute and the exposure comparison between different organs

Note this is purelu a modeling and simulation (M&S) exercise. The result should be taken with a healthy dose of skeptism, and should not be used for medical advice. 

## Set up

The simulation is run with Rstudio (version) and the following packages (version) ....

- tidyverse
- mrgsolve
- mrggsave
...

## Model Development

The PBPK model is borrowed from ... with skin compartment added ....

## Model validation

The model is validated using the data from ....

The IV ...

The oral ...

## Oral dosing from Transino II

The recommended oral dosing of Transino II roughlt translated into 1.5g of TXA per 12 hour. 

## 


## Sensitivity Analysis

### Absorption rate

### Dosing amount

### Body weight

### Renal Impairment

## Conclusion 

Overall, the plasma concentraion following the Transino II recommended dosing scheme would lead to safe plasma TXA concentration with no apparent risk of clotting ...
